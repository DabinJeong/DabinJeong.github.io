We present a novel computational method to construct **condition-specific transcriptional networks from transcriptome data**. Regulatory interaction between transcription factors (TFs) and target genes (TGs) is very complex, specifically multiple-to-multiple relations. We, therefore, employed kernel CCA to embed TFs and TGs into a new space where the correlation of TFs and TGs are reflected thus identifying multiple-to-multiple TFâ€“TG relations in certain biological condition.
